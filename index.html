        <p1>Hi! I'm Cie! I used to know how to use HTML like 4 years ago but I'm pretty sure I forgot almost everything. <br>
        I took an intro to web design class in my freshman year of highschool. All I did in that class was make basic <br>
        websites using code we copied from a textbook and then I'd just play "unblocked" flash games <br> because there was always time left in the class. <br> <br>
        Anyways, I'm rambling on for no reason so if you read this far, you're cool.
        Here. Have a cookie.</p1>

        <p2>This is a stock photo of a cookie that I got from google. You can't actually eat it, unfortunately. <br> The source says it's from a website called depositphotos.com. <p2a><a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/DPiXSVAKFbPVnrEz5">Here's the link.</a></p2a> </p2>
