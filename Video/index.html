      I really like the game League of Legends. It is the most fun (at times), frustrating (most of the time), addicting games I have ever played. 
	  According to my friend, I have racked up over 900 hours on this game, which is insane. To make the trailer, I used Movavi video editor 
	  (as you can clearly tell by the watermark). The gameplay is one of my better plays, but I'm very sad that the gameplay clip doesn't have audio.
	  I unfortunately couldn't do anything about that because a new patch came out, so I couldn't go back and re-save the clip with in-game audio.
